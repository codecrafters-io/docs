# Local development

To run the code for your challenge locally, you'll need `node` installed. Our test runners use Node 18 (as of April 2024).

The script for your challenge (like `./your_grep.sh`) will automatically compile your code using `node` before executing it. It'll
look something like this:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

exec node app/main.js "$@"
```

# File structure

- The files for your solution are placed in the `app/` directory.
- `app/main.js` contains the `main()` function, which is what the test runner executes.

# Adding more files

You can add more files and directories to `app/`. The test runner will include them when compiling your code.

For example, if you add a file at `app/foo.js`, you could use it like so:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript app/foo.js
function foo() {
    console.log('Hello from foo!');
}

function bar() {
    console.log('Hello from bar!');
}

module.exports = { foo, bar };
````

```javascript app/main.js
const { foo, bar } = require('./foo');

function main() {
    foo();  // Uses the foo function from foo.js
    bar();  // Uses the bar function from foo.js
}
````

</CodeGroup>

<Note>We use the CommonJS syntax for importing and exporting of modules.</Note>

# Adding dependencies

You can add dependencies to your project using `npm`.

<Note>Instructions for adding depedencies will be documented soon.</Note>
