## Local development

To run the code for your challenge locally, you'll need `cargo` installed. Our test runners use version `1.76` (as of April 2024).

The script for your challenge (like `./your_bittorrent.sh`) will automatically compile and run your code using `cargo run`. It'll
look something like this:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

exec cargo run \
    --quiet \
    --release \
    --target-dir=/tmp/codecrafters-bittorrent-target \
    --manifest-path $(dirname "$0")/Cargo.toml -- "$@"
```

## File structure

- The files for your solution are placed in the `src` directory.
- `src/main.rs` contains the `main` function, which is what the test runner executes.

## Adding more files

You can add more files and directories to the `src` directory. The test runner will include them when compiling your code.

Rust uses [modules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/mod.html) to organize code. For example, to define the `foo` module, create a file at `src/foo.rs`.

You can use functions and variables from `foo.rs` in your main code like so:
<CodeGroup>

```Rust src/main.rs
mod foo;

fn main() {
  foo::foo(); // Calls the foo function from foo.rs
}
```

```Rust src/foo.rs
pub fn foo() {
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  Remember to make `foo()` accessible to `main.rs` by adding the `pub`
  identifier
</Note>

Refer to the Rust [documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-05-separating-modules-into-different-files.html) for more details.

## Adding dependencies

You can add dependencies to your program using `cargo add`.

For example, to add the `rand` crate, run the following command:

```bash
cargo add rand
```

This command will automatically find the latest version of the `rand` crate and add it to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
rand = "0.8.5"
```

It'll also make changes to your `Cargo.lock` file.
