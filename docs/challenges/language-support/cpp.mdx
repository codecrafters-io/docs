# Local development

To run the code for your challenge locally, you'll need `cmake` & `make` installed.

The script for your challenge (like `./your_sqlite3.sh`) will automatically compile your code using the rules defined in `CMakeLists.txt` before executing it. It'll
look something like this:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

set -e
cmake $(dirname $0) > /dev/null
make > /dev/null
exec ./server "$@"
```

# File structure

- The files for your solution are placed in the `src/` directory.
- `src/Main.cpp` contains the `main` function, which is what the test runner executes.
- `CMakeLists.txt` contains the rules for compiling your program.

# Adding more files

You can add more files and directories to `src/`. The test runner will include them when compiling your code.

For example, if you added a file at `src/Foo.cpp`, you could use it like so:

<CodeGroup>
```cpp src/Foo.cpp
#pragma once

#include <iostream>

void foo() {
std::cout << "Hello, World!";
}

````

```cpp src/Main.cpp
#include "Foo.cpp"

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    foo()   // calls foo() defined in src/Foo.cpp
}
````

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  `#pragma once` is a preprocessor directive that ensures the header file is
  only included once to prevent any duplication issues.
</Note>

# Adding dependencies

To add a third-party dependency such as the `asio` to a C++ project, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download the library">
    Download the library files from the source. `asio` can be downloaded from [here](https://think-async.com/Asio/Download.html).
    <Note>
      Some libraries come built into your operating system and don't need to be
      installed. E.g. `pthread` comes built-in to Unix systems (Linux and
      macOS).{" "}
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Extract the library">Extract the downloaded file to a directory in your project. For example, `codecrafters-sqlite-cpp/libs/asio-1.30.2`.</Step>
  <Step title="Update your Include Path">
 Add the path to the Asio headers to your `CMakeLists.txt` file using the `include_directories()` function. The headers are usually inside the `include/` subdirectory of the library.
```CMake
include_directories(${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/libs/asio-1.30.2/include)
```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Link against the library (Only required for non-header-only libraries)">
    Add the following line to the `CMakeLists.txt` file:
```CMake
target_link_libraries(server my_library)
```

This will link the library against the build target.

  </Step>
