## Local development

To run the code for your challenge locally, you'll need [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/) & `make` installed.

You'll also need the `VCPKG_ROOT` environment variable set to the path where vcpkg is installed.

The script for your challenge (like `./your_sqlite3.sh`) will automatically compile your code using the rules defined in `CMakeLists.txt` before executing it. It'll
look something like this:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

set -e
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=${VCPKG_ROOT}/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
cmake --build ./build
exec ./build/server "$@"
```

## File structure

- The files for your solution are placed in the `src/` directory.
- `src/Main.cpp` contains the `main` function, which is what the test runner executes.
- `CMakeLists.txt` contains the rules for compiling your program.

## Adding more files

You can add more files and directories to `src/`. The test runner will include them when compiling your code.

For example, if you want to create a function `foo()` in another file, you need to:
1. Add a header file `Foo.hpp` and define `foo()` there.
2. Add a cpp file `Foo.cpp` and implement `foo()` there.

<CodeGroup>
```cpp src/Foo.hpp
// Function definitions go here
#pragma once

void foo();
```

```cpp src/Foo.cpp
// Implementations of functions defined in src/Foo.hpp go here
#include <iostream>

void foo() {
    std::cout << "Hello from foo!";
}
```

```cpp src/Main.cpp
#include "Foo.hpp"

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    foo(); // calls foo() defined in src/Foo.hpp
}
```
</CodeGroup>
<Note>The `#pragma once` directive in `src/Foo.hpp` ensures the header file is included only once during compilation.</Note>

## Adding dependencies

To add a third-party dependency such as the `asio` to a C++ project, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the dependency to vcpkg.json">
    Run `vcpkg add port asio` to add the dependency to the `vcpkg.json` file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the dependency to CMakeLists.txt">
    To be able to use the dependency in your project, you'll need to add it to `CMakeLists.txt`.

    ```CMake
    find_package(asio CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(server PRIVATE asio asio::asio)
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Include the dependency in your code">
    You can now include the dependency in your code.

    ```cpp
    #include <asio.hpp>
    ```

    On your next push, the test runner will automatically install the dependency before compiling your code.
  </Step>
