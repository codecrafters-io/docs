# Local development

To run the code for your challenge locally, you'll need `dotnet` installed. Our test runners use Dotnet 8.0 (as of April 2024).

The script for your challenge (like `./your_sqlite3.sh`) will automatically compile your code using `dotnet` before executing it. It'll
look something like this:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

exec dotnet run --project . --configuration Release "$@"
```

# File structure

- The files for your solution are placed in the `src/` directory.
- `src/Program.cs` contains the `main` function, which is what the test runner executes.
- The `.csproj` file defines project settings, target frameworks and dependencies.

# Adding more files

You can add more files and directories to `src/`. The test runner will include them when compiling your code.

For example, if you added a file at `src/Foo.cs`, you could use it like so:

<CodeGroup>
```csharp src/Foo.cs
public class Foo {
    public static void foo() {
        System.out.println("Hello world!");
    }
}
```

```csharp src/Program.cs
public class Main {
    public static void Main(String[] args) {
        Foo.foo();  // calls the method foo() from Foo class in Foo.cs
    }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

By default, all classes in `src/` belong to the same namespace. This namespace is called the _project namespace_. E.g. If the project name is `MyProject`, all classes are defined under the `MyProject` namespace. This is why you can call `foo()` without importing anything.

If you want to define a class under a _different_ namespace, you'll need to enclose it within braces like this:

```csharp
namespace AnotherNamespace {
    public class Foo {
        public static void foo(string[] args) {
            // write code here
        }
    }
}
```

Let's say you want to define the `Foo` class in `Foo.cs` under the `AnotherNamespace` namespace.

<CodeGroup>

```csharp src/Foo.cs
namespace AnotherNamespace {
    public class Foo {
        public static void foo() {
            System.out.println("Hello world!");
        }
    }
}
```

```csharp src/Program.cs
using AnotherNamespace

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Foo.foo();  // Uses the foo function from Foo class defined under AnotherNamespace
    }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  If there are `Foo` classes in both the `AnotherNamespace` namespace and the
  namespace where `Main` class is defined, the one in `AnotherNamespace` will be
  called.
</Note>

# Adding dependencies

You can add dependencies to your project by using `dotnet`.

For example, to add the `Newtonsoft.Json` package, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json
```

It will also update your `.csproj` file with the package reference:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json" Version="13.0.1" />
</ItemGroup>
```
