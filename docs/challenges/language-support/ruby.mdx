# Local development

To run the code for your challenge locally, you'll need `ruby` installed. Our test runners use version `3.3` (as of May 2024).

The script for your challenge (like `./spawn_redis_server.sh`) will run your code using [Bundler](https://bundler.io/), a dependency manager which comes preinstalled with Ruby. It looks something like this:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

exec bundle exec ruby app/main.rb "$@"
```

# File structure

- The files for your solution are placed in the `app/` directory.
- `app/main.rb` is the entrypoint of the project.

# Adding more files

You can add more files and directories to `app/`. The test runner will include them when compiling your code.

For example, if you added a file at `app/foo.rb`, you could use it like so:

<CodeGroup>
```Ruby app/foo.rb
def foo
    puts "Hello world!"
end
````

```Ruby app/main.rb
require_relative 'foo'

foo();  # Calls foo() defined in app/foo.rb
```

</CodeGroup>

# Adding dependencies

`Gemfile` lists your project's dependencies. You can add dependencies by specifying the name of the gem and optionally the version.

For example, To add the `nokogiri` gem, add the following line to your `Gemfile`:

```Gemfile
gem 'nokogiri'
```

Then run the following command to install it:

```bash
bundle install
```

This command will also update your `Gemfile.lock` file.
