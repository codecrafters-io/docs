# Local development

To run the code for your challenge locally, you'll need `python3` installed. Our test runners use version `3.12` (as of April 2024).

The script for your challenge (like `./spawn_redis_server.sh`) will run the code using this version of the Python interpreter. It looks something like this:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

exec python3 -m app.main "$@"
```

# File structure

- The files for your solution are placed in the `app/` directory.
- `app/main.py` contains the `main` function, which is what the test runner executes.

# Adding more files

You can add more files and directories to `app/`. The test runner will include them when compiling your code.

For example, if you added a file at `app/foo.py`, you could use it like so:

<CodeGroup>
```Python app/foo.py
def foo():
    print("Hello world!")
````

```Python app/main.py

from app.foo import foo

def main():
    foo() // Uses the foo function from foo.py
```

</CodeGroup>

# Adding dependencies

<Note>
  Not all challenges support managing dependencies via Pipenv at the moment.
  This will be fixed with the next Python version update.
</Note>

We use **Pipenv** for managing dependencies.

First install **Pipenv** using `pip`

```bash
pip install pipenv
```

Now you can add dependencies to your project using `pipenv`

For example, to add the `requests` library, you can run the following command:

```bash
pipenv install requests
```

This will create a virtual environment (if it doesn't exist) and add the following line to your `Pipfile`:

```toml
[packages]
requests = "*"
```

It’ll also make changes to your `Pipfile.lock`.
