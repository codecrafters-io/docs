# Local development

To run the code for your challenge locally, you'll need `go` installed. Our test runners use `go` version `1.19` (as of November 2023).

The script for your challenge (like `./your_bittorrent.sh`) will automatically compile your code using `go build` before executing it.

# File structure

- The files for your solution are placed in the `app/` directory.
- `app/main.go` contains the `main` function, which is what the test runner executes.

# Adding more files

You can add more files and directories to `app/`. The test runner will include them when compiling your code.

For example, if you added a file at `app/foo.go`, you could use it like so:

<CodeGroup>

```go app/main.go
package main

fun main() {
    foo() // Uses the foo function from foo.go
}
```

```go app/foo.go
package main

fun foo() {
    println("Hello world!")
}
```

</CodeGroup>

All files in `app/` must have a `package main` declaration at the top of the file. If you want to extract files into a different package,
you can create a new folder in `app/` and add the `package` declaration to the top of each file in that folder.

Let's say you wanted to extract `foo.go` into the `bar` package. You'd move `foo.go` into the `app/bar` and add the relevant `package` declaration to the top of `foo.go`:

<CodeGroup>
```go app/bar/foo.go
package bar

fun foo() {
    println("Hello world!")
}
```

```go app/main.go
package main

import "github.com/codecrafters-io/dns-server-starter-go/app/bar" // Adjust this based on the package name in go.mod

fun main() {
    bar.foo() // Uses the foo function from app/bar/foo.go
}
```
</CodeGroup>

Note that you'll need to update the import statement in `main.go` to use the new package name (Example: `github.com/codecrafters-io/dns-server-starter-go/app/bar`). You'll
find the first part of the package name in `go.mod`.

# Adding dependencies

You can add dependencies to your project by adding them to your `go.mod` file. You can use the `go get` command for this.

For example, to add the `github.com/spf13/cobra` library, you can run the following command:

```bash
$ go get github.com/spf13/cobra

# Output:
#
# go: downloading github.com/spf13/cobra v1.8.0
# go: downloading github.com/inconshreveable/mousetrap v1.1.0
# go: added github.com/spf13/cobra v1.8.0
```

This'll add the following line to your `go.mod` file:

```go
require github.com/spf13/cobra v1.1.3
```

It'll also make changes to your `go.sum` file.

When you push your code next, the runner will automatically download the dependency.

You can use the dependency in your code like so:

<CodeGroup>
```go app/main.go
package main

import (
    "github.com/spf13/cobra"
)

func main() {
    var rootCmd = &cobra.Command{
        Use:   "test",
        Short: "test",
        Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
            // Do Stuff Here
        },
    }

    rootCmd.Execute()
}
```
</CodeGroup>
