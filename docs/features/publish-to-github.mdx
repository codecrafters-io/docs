Once you click 'Publish,' any subsequent changes made to the `master` branch of your CodeCrafters repository will automatically sync to GitHub.

<Note>
  <p>Don't push changes to your GitHub repository directly.</p>
  <p>
    Push to your CodeCrafters Git repository instead, and we'll sync changes to
    GitHub.
  </p>
</Note>

<Warning>
  Any changes pushed to your GitHub repository directly will be overridden.
