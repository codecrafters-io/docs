This integration allows you to publish your CodeCrafters repositories to GitHub with just a couple of clicks.

Each CodeCrafters Challenge includes an option in the language dropdown menu to **"Publish to GitHub"**:

</Frame>

Once you click 'Publish,' any subsequent changes made to the `master` branch of your CodeCrafters repository will automatically sync to GitHub.

<Warning>
  This synchronization can overwrite the selected GitHub repository.  
  We strongly recommend NOT making changes directly to the synced GitHub repository to avoid accidental data loss.
</Warning>

<Note>
  This synchronization is *one-way* â€“ changes made to the GitHub repository will NOT sync back to your CodeCrafters repository.
