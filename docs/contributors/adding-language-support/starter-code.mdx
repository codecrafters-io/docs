Starter code is the code that we provide to users when they start a challenge. It's the code that they'll be building on top of.

[Here's an example](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-redis/tree/main/compiled_starters/python).

## 1. Copy from Language Template

Use [course-sdk](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/course-sdk) to copy the starter code skeleton and Dockerfile from the [language-templates](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/language-templates) repository.

<Steps>
<Step title="Clone build-your-own-<challenge>">
  For example, if you’re adding support for the Kafka challenge, clone the [build-your-own-kafka](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-kafka) repository.

</Step>

<Step title="Run course-sdk add-language <language>">
a. Verify that the language you want to add is available in the [languages](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/language-templates/tree/main/languages) folder in the language-templates repository.

b. Install [course-sdk](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/course-sdk) if it’s not already installed.

c. In the cloned challenge repository, copy the starter code skeleton and Dockerfile with this command:

```bash
course-sdk add-language <language>
```

</Step>
</Steps>

## 2. Implement the starter code

<Steps>

<Step title="Pass the first stage">
  Extend the copied starter code skeleton to pass the first stage of the
  challenge.
</Step>

<Step title="Comment out a key step">
  Comment out a key step in the code, so that it doesn't pass the first stage initially. 
  
  When uncommented, this code should then be able to pass the first stage.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Ensure CI tests pass

We have comprehensive CI tests in place to ensure that the starter code and Dockerfile for each language are valid.

In the cloned challenge repository, run the tests locally with this command:

```bash
course-sdk test <language>
```

Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request (PR).

## First stage solution

To make it easier for users to get started, we automatically generate a solution to the first stage of the challenge. This is done by uncommenting lines in the starter code.

**Example**:

<Frame caption="Stage 1 solution, auto-generated from starter code">
  <img className="w-full" src="/img/contributors/first-stage-solution.png" />
</Frame>

The way this works is that [course-sdk](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/course-sdk) will look for markers like this in the starter code:

```python
# Uncomment this to pass the first stage
```

These markers will be deleted and any code after them will be uncommented to generate the solution.

The full logic for this is [here](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/course-sdk/blob/4beb239db2293a5a5b109dac737c6a2d70d62d1a/lib/compilers/first-stage-solutions-compiler.ts).
