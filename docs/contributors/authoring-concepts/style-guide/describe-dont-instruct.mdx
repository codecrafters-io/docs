title: "Describe, Don't Instruct"
---

When explaining how something works, describe the facts neutrally rather than instructing the reader. Avoid "you/your" and phrasing like "you need to" or "this is how you".

Think Wikipedia, not WikiHow.

## Bad Example

> To encode a simple string, you need to use the `+` prefix followed by the string contents and a CRLF terminator. You then get a result like `+OK\r\n`.

<Warning>
  This reads like instructions for a task. It's addressed to "you" and uses "you
  need to".
</Warning>

## Good Example

> Simple strings are encoded like this: `+<string>\r\n`
>
> For example, `OK` is encoded as `+OK\r\n`.

<Check>
  This describes how the encoding works. It states facts rather than giving
  instructions.
</Check>

## Exceptions

### Procedural Content

If the concept is explicitly about _how to do something_, instructional language is appropriate.

For example, a concept like "TCP Servers in Java" is teaching someone how to build something, so "you" language fits naturally:

> To accept incoming connections, you'll need to call `serverSocket.accept()`. This method blocks until a client connects.

An easy way to remember: "Here's how X works" is descriptive. "Here's how to do X" is instructional.
