title: "Question Explanations"
---

When explaining quiz answers, follow a two-part structure:

1. Explain why the selected option is correct or incorrect
2. If the selected option was incorrect, state the correct answer in another paragraph and optionally explain why

Just repeating the correct answer isn't useful. When a user gets something wrong, it's a great opportunity to address why their thinking mismatched.

## Bad Example

> **Question:** What does `PING` return in Redis?
>
> - `OK`
> - `PONG` ✅
> - `PING`
>
> **Explanation:**<br/>
>
> The correct answer is `PONG`.

<Warning>
  This just restates the answer. It doesn't help the user understand why they
  might have chosen wrong.
</Warning>

## Good Example

> **Question:** What does `PING` return in Redis?
>
> - `OK`
> - `PONG` ✅
> - `PING`
>
> **Explanation:**<br/>
> `OK` is the response for commands like `SET`, not `PING`.<br/><br/>
> The correct answer is `PONG`. Redis uses this pattern to check if the server is alive.

  This addresses a likely point of confusion, then reinforces the correct answer
  with context.
