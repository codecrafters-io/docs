title: "How do I use the CLI?"
---

The CodeCrafters CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to run tests & view test results
from your local machine. Using the CLI is faster than using Git since you don't need to
commit your changes to run tests.

If you haven't installed the CLI yet, [read this](/cli/installation).

To use the CLI, navigate to a CodeCrafters repository on your local machine and run the `codecrafters test` command:

```bash
codecrafters test
```

To run tests against all previous stages first, add the `--previous` flag:

```bash
codecrafters test --previous
```

You should see logs like this:

```bash
Running tests on your codebase. Streaming logs...

[stage-1] Test failed (try setting 'debug: true' in your codecrafters.yml to see more details)

```

You can then make changes to your codebase and re-run the tests by running `codecrafters test` again. You don't
need to commit your changes using Git to run tests using the CLI.
