title: "How do I use the CLI?"
---

The CodeCrafters CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to run tests & view test results from your local machine.

If you haven't installed the CLI yet, [read this](/cli/installation).

To use the CLI, navigate to a CodeCrafters repository on your local machine and run the `codecrafters test` command:

```bash
codecrafters test
```

To run tests against all previous stages first, add the `--previous` flag:

```bash
codecrafters test --previous
```

You should see logs like this:

```bash
Running tests on your codebase. Streaming logs...

[stage-1] Looks like your program has terminated. A redis server is expected to be a long-running process.
[stage-1] Test failed (try setting 'debug: true' in your codecrafters.yml to see more details)

```

You can then make changes to your codebase and re-run the tests by running `codecrafters test` again. You don't
need to commit your changes using Git to run tests using the CLI.
