### Completely new to programming?

We recommend **boot.dev** or the **Exercism Bootcamp**.

Both offer an introduction to programming, but they shine in different areas.

* **[boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/?promo=CODECRAFTERS)** _(partner link)_ is self-paced and specialises in backend development. 
You'll first learn the fundamentals of coding, and then go to more advanced topics like API design and database management. 
Our [perks page](https://codecrafters.io/perks) has a deal!


* **[Exercism bootcamp](https://bootcamp.exercism.org)** runs on a specific schedule and focuses on the frontend. 
You'll start by strengthening your understanding of fundamental programming concepts. Next, you build a portfolio of frontend projects.

### Picking up language basics?

If you're not new to programming, but want to catch up on the basics of a new language, 
its official resources are generally a good place to start. We do want to make two recommendations however:
* For Golang, we recommend [boot.dev's module](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-golang). 
Our [perks page](https://codecrafters.io/perks) has a deal!
* For TypeScript, we recommend [Execute Program](https://www.executeprogram.com/courses/typescript-basics). Our [perks page](https://codecrafters.io/perks) has a deal!
* For most other languages, [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) offers a language learning track comprising practice challenges.
